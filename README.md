## Key Customizations

### 1. **RTL Language Support**
- Added right-to-left (RTL) text direction support
- Adjusted UI components for RTL display
- Enables compatibility with Hebrew and other RTL languages

### 2. **Theme Customization**
- Applied Cloudscape design system theming options
- Adjusted color schemes and component styles

### 3. **Extended Regional Deployment**
- Included support for additional AWS regions, such as il-central-1

### 4. **Document Chat Functionality**
- Implemented feature to upload documents
- Use of Amazon Bedrock Converse API, native document support functionality
- Enhances chatbot's utility for document analysis

## Value of Customizations

These modifications showcase the adaptability of the original AWS sample project:

1. **Localization**: RTL support opens up the chatbot to markets using Hebrew and other RTL languages, demonstrating how simple changes can make a product more accessible.

2. **Brand Alignment**: Integrating Cloudscape design elements shows how organizations can easily align the chatbot's look and feel with their brand or preferred design system.

3. **Regional Flexibility**: Adding deployment options for more regions illustrates how organizations can adapt the chatbot to meet local data residency requirements or improve regional performance.

4. **Customization Potential**: These changes serve as practical examples for organizations looking to tailor the chatbot to their specific needs, showing that impactful customization doesn't always require extensive code changes.

5. **Learning Opportunity**: The modification process provides practical insights into adapting Cloudscape components and CDK constructs. This is valuable for developers and organizations looking to customize AWS-based applications and infrastructure.

While these modifications don't fundamentally alter the core functionality, they demonstrate how targeted changes can significantly enhance the chatbot experience.
